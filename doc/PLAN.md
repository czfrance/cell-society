## Design Overview


## Design Details

Here is a graphical look at my design:

![This is cool, too bad you can't see it](images/online-shopping-uml-example.png "An initial UI")

made from [a tool that generates UML from existing code](http://staruml.io/).


## Use Cases

 * Team generated Use Case
 ```java
 Something thing = new Something();
 Order o = thing.makeOrder("coffee,large,black");
 o.update(13);
 ```
* Apply the rules to a middle cell: set the next state of a cell to dead by counting its number of neighbors using the Game of Life rules for a cell in the middle (i.e., with all its neighbors)


* Apply the rules to an edge cell: set the next state of a cell to live by counting its number of neighbors using the Game of Life rules for a cell on the edge (i.e., with some of its neighbors missing)


* Move to the next generation: update all cells in a simulation from their current state to their next state and display the result graphically


* Switch simulations: load a new simulation from a data file, replacing the current running simulation with the newly loaded one


* Set a simulation parameter: set the value of a parameter, probCatch, for a simulation, Fire, based on the value given in a data file
