Fish eat microscopic kelp. The supply of kelp is never exhausted. Every turn of the simulation a fish will move to a random adjacent cell unless all four are occupied. If the fish has survived the number of turns necessary to breed it produces a new fish if there is an empty adjacent cell. <br><br>

Sharks eat fish. Each turn if there is a fish adjacent to a shark the shark eats it. If there are multiple adjacent fish the shark eats one at random. If there are no adjacent fish the shark moves in the same manner as fish. After eating or moving if the shark has survived the number of turns necessary to breed it produces a new shark if there is an empty adjacent cell.
